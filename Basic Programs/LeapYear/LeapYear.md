# Leap Year

A **leap year** is a year that has **366 days** instead of 365. The extra day is added to **February** (so February has **29 days**).

## Why it exists

A solar year (Earth going around the Sun) is about **365.2422 days**, not exactly 365.  
If we never added extra days, the calendar would slowly drift and seasons would shift over time.

## Leap year rules (Gregorian calendar)

A year is a leap year if:

1. It’s divisible by **4** → ✅ leap year  
2. **Except** if it’s divisible by **100** → ❌ not a leap year  
3. **Except** if it’s divisible by **400** → ✅ leap year  

---

## Examples

- **2024**: divisible by 4, not by 100 → ✅ leap year  
- **1900**: divisible by 100, not by 400 → ❌ not a leap year  
- **2000**: divisible by 400 → ✅ leap year  

---

## Quick check

- If the year ends with **00**, it must be divisible by **400** to be a leap year.  
- Otherwise, just check if it’s divisible by **4**.
